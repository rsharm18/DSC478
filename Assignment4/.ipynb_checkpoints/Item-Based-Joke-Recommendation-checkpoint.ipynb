    "#### 2.d Develop your own item-based collaborative filtering recommender that uses a model-based approach (separating the training and the prediction tasks). In the training component, item-item similarities for all pairs of items are computed and stored in an appropriate data structure. Your training function should be able to use different similarity functions (passed as a parameter) including Cosine Similarity or Pearson Correlation. The prediction (or estimation) function should take as parameters a target user, an item, a value of k, and the similarities data structure and return the predicted rating on the target item for the target user. The predicted rating should be based on the weighted average of the target user's ratings on k most similar items to the target item. You should test the prediction accuracy of your estimation function (using a cross-validation similar to part b, above) and provide a plot of cross-validation accuracies across a range of values of k. Using the best value of k, demonstrate the functionality of your recommender by generating recommendations for several anecdotal users (similar to part a, above)."
